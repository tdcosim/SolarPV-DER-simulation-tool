Solar photovoltaic distributed energy resources (PV-DER) are power electronic inverter based generation (IBG) connected to the electric power distribution system (eg. roof top solar PV systems). This tool can be used to simulate the dynamics of a single DER connected to a stiff voltage source as shown in the following schematic:

![schematic of PV-DER](PVDER_schematic.png)

## Basics
The dynamics of the DER are modelled using dynamic phasors. Detailed description of the concepts behind this tool can be found in the IEEE publication [Dynamic Modeling of Solar PV Systems for Distribution System Stability Analysis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333985171_Dynamic_Modeling_of_Solar_PV_Systems_for_Distribution_System_Stability_Analysis) and detailed list of equations can be found in the [Model specification document.](docs/PV_DER_model_specification_rev3.docx)

### Features
The following features are available currently:
1. Single phase, three phase balanced, and three phase unbalanced (phase voltages may be unbalanced) DER models.
2. Run simulation in stand alone mode with internal grid voltage source (stiff) model.
3. Run simulation in loop mode where grid voltage is supplied every time step by a third party program.
4. Customize all aspects of the model through a [JSON](config_der.json) file which provides access to parameters in all the model components. 
5. Visualize or retrieve simulation results for voltages, current, active, and reactive power.
5. Introduce solar insolation events (in all modes), grid voltage, and frequency change events (in stand alone mode).
6. Retrieve and modify model parameters from a third party program.
7. Following smart inverter features are available: Low/High voltage ride through (LVRT/HVRT), Low frequency ride through (LFRT), and Volt-VAR control logic.

2. [OpenAI Gym Distributed Energy Resource Environment  (Gym-DER)](https://github.com/sibyjackgrove/gym-SolarPVDER-environment)

## Using the tool
This tool can be imported as a normal python module:

```python
import pvder
```

### Using the stand alone single phase DER model with 10 kW power rating
The following steps are required. Additional documentation on attributes and methods are available [here](docs/PVDER_flags_variables_methods.md).
1. First import the following classes:
```
from pvder.DER_components_single_phase import SolarPV_DER_SinglePhase
from pvder.grid_components import Grid
from pvder.dynamic_simulation import DynamicSimulation
from pvder.simulation_events import SimulationEvents
from pvder.simulation_utilities import SimulationResults
```
1. Create a **_SimulationEvents_** object: This object is used to add or remove disturbance events occurs during the simulation.
```
events = SimulationEvents()
```
2. Create a **Grid** object: This object describes the steady state model for the grid voltage source. It needs to be supplied with an **_SimulationEvents_** object.
```
grid = Grid(events=events)
```
3. Create a **SolarPV_DER_SinglePhase** or **SolarPV_DER_ThreePhase** object: This object describes the dynamic DER model. It needs both an **_SimulationEvents_** object, and a path name for JSON file containing the DER configuration parameters.  It also needs a **Grid** object in stand alone mode). Additionaly either the power rating of the DER or the id for the parameter dictionary should be provided.
```
PV_DER = SolarPV_DER_SinglePhase(events=events,configFile=r'config_der.json',gridModel=grid,derId= '10',standAlone = True)
```
4. Create a **DynamicSimulation** object: This object runs the simulation and stores the solution. It takes **_SimulationEvents_**, **Grid** and, **SolarPV_DER_SinglePhase** objects as arguments.
```
sim = DynamicSimulation(grid_model=grid,PV_model=PV_DER,events = events)
```
5. Create a **SimulationResults** object: This object is used to visualize the simulation results.
```
results = SimulationResults(simulation = sim)
```
6. Add an event (for e.g. solar insolation change at 10.0 s):
```
events.add_solar_event(10,90)
```
7. Specify simulation flags (for e.g. set the DEBUG_SIMULATION and DEBUG_POWER flag to true to observe the power at each time step.):
```
sim.DEBUG_SIMULATION = False
sim.DEBUG_POWER = False
```
8. Specify simulation stop time (for e.g. 20.0 s):
```
sim.tStop = 20.0
```
9. Run the simulation:
```
sim.run_simulation()
```
10. Visualize the results (for e.g. the power output at PCC-LV side):
```
results.PER_UNIT = False
results.plot_DER_simulation(plot_type='active_power_Ppv_Pac_PCC')
```
